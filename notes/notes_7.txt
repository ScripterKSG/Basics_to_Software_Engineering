Lambda and zip
--------------
Lambda is an anonymous function that can be created at runtime. 
Anonymous means that it should not be bound to a name.

>>> def f (x):
...     return x**2
>>> g = lambda x: x**2
>>>
>>> f(3) == g(3)
True
Note that the lambda definition does not include a "return" statement -- 
it always contains an expression which is returned.

Syntax:
lambda arg1, arg2, ...argN : expression using arguments
>>> f = lambda x, y, z: x + y + z
>>> f(1, 2, 3)
6
>>>

Zip:
zip is a generator that combines two objects in a tuple.

>>> a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> b = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
>>> c = zip(a, b)
>>> c
<zip object at 0x01939440>
>>> list(c)
[(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c'), (4, 'd')]
>>> list(c)
[]

--------------
Cannot be done for iterators
- list(iterator) and len(iterator) == 0 
iterators might generate numbers indefintely, e.g., count() in itertools.

- if iterator or if (iterator == []) 
e.g.,
>>> x = []
>>> y = iter(x)
>>> y
<list_iterator object at 0x000001A70B1CAEF0>
>>> if y :
...    print("Full List")
... else :
...    print("Empty List")
...
Full List
>>>

Indexables:
---------
If an iterable is indexable, you can access it's elements via an index and that the elements are finite.
If an iterable is not indexable, then it might be infinit and you cannot access it's elements via an index. 
For example, if x is not idexable, to iterate throught it's elements, you may either do "for i in x:" or
p = iter(x); val = next(p); ...

RMSE:
Other implementations using zip, map, lambda.
(1) rmse_range_for: indexing
(2) rmse_zip_for: improvements: iterates through tuples
              zip: it combines two objects in a tuple.
              z is iterable over iterables of lenght 2.
              zip is a generator.
